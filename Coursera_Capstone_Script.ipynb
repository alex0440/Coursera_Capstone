    "# INTRODUCTION / BUSINESS PROBLEM\n",
    "# This project will use data collected from collisions in different scenarios to try predict the severity of an accident prior to it occuring. \n",
    "# The value of predicting severity of accidents is immesurable in terms of number accidents potentially avoided and the cost of treatment associated with those accidents.\n",
    "# By building a model which can predict accident severity in different conditions, warnings may be sent to drivers alerting them to environment conditions with potential for high severity.\n",
    "# By understanding the relationship between different environment conditions, we can determine what areas of road safety are important for drivers to be vigilant of."

    "# By understanding the relationship between different environment conditions, we can determine what areas of road safety are important for governments to focus on and refine.\n",
